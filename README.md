## üìö Mathematical Foundation

### Return Calculation
$$R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$$

### Portfolio Value Evolution
$$V_t = V_{t-1}(1 + R_t - c|\Delta w_t|)$$

where:
- $V_t$ is portfolio value at time t
- $R_t$ is return at time t
- $c$ is transaction cost
- $\Delta w_t$ is change in position

### Key Risk Metrics
- VaR: $P(R_p \leq VaR_\alpha) = \alpha$
- Sharpe: $SR = \frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{\sigma_p}$
- Maximum Drawdown: $MDD = \min_t{\frac{V_t - \max_{s\leq t}V_s}{\max_{s\leq t}V_s}}$
